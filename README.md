# calculator

A simple calculator developed as the culminating project for Foundations portion of
the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I will once again be using FlexBox for the layout
and I will style the calculator to look like a physical calculator.

## Planned Features

- All the basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear button to clear the display.
- Delete button to delete the last digit entered.
- Keyboard support for all buttons.
    - Backspace for delete.
    - Enter for equals.
    - Escape for clear.
    - Numbers and operators for their respective buttons.
- All operations will be performed in the order they are entered, not necessarily following the order of operations.
    - For example, entering `2 + 3 * 4` will be calculated as 2 + 3 = 5 * 4 = 20.

## Technologies Used
